"""Hy-VLA quickstart smoke test.

Loads the released ``tencent/Hy-VLA-RoboTwin`` checkpoint, runs one
forward pass on dummy inputs, and prints the resulting action tensor
shape. Use this to verify that the install + ckpt download path works
before plugging Hy-VLA into a real RoboTwin / hardware loop.

Usage::

    python scripts/quick_start.py
